  # DESCRIPTION
  # Computes the best model on data on given data selecting
  # the best method on the training data based on the last
  # TimeSteps4ModelSelection time steps.
  #
  # INPUT
  # Data[1:n]                Numerical vector with n time series values.
  #
  # OPTIONAL
  # Horizon          Number indicating forecast horizon. Horizon = 1 means
  #                  one-step forecast and Horizon > 1 means a one-step forecast
  #                  and all multi-step forecasts from horizon 2 to 'Horizon'.
  # Aggregation[1:Scales]    Numerical vector carrying numbers whose index is
  #                          associated with the wavelet level. The numbers
  #                          indicate the number of time in points used for

  #                          If set to "auto", wavelet models from levels 1 to 5
  #                          are used for model selection.
  # Method                   String indicating which method to use
  #                          Available methods: 'r'  = Regression
  #                                             'nn' = Neural Network
  # TimeSteps4ModelSelection Number of time steps of data (newest part) on which
  #                          a model selection is performed.
  # crit                     String with criterion.
  #                          Available criterions: "AIC" = Akaikes Info. Crit.
  #                                                "MAE" = Mean Abs. Error
  #                                                "MRE" = Mean Root Error
  # InSampleMAE              Boolean, deciding if in-sample-forecast based on
  #                          rolling forecasting origin is computed or not.
  #                          TRUE = Computation of in-sample-forecast.
  #                          FALSE = No computation.
  # NumClusters      Number of clusters used for parallel computing.
  # itermax          Number of iterations for evolutionary optimization method.

  # OUTPUT
  # Model    List of 7 elements containing model specifications:
  # Data[1:n]                Numerical vector with n time series values.
  # Method                   String indicating which method to use
  #                          Available methods: 'r'  = Regression
  #                                             'nn' = Neural Network
  # Aggregation[1:Scales]    Numerical vector with best aggregation scheme found.
  # CoefficientCombination[1:Scales+1]    Numerical vector with best combination
  #                          of coefficients found for fixed aggregation scheme.
  # Horizon          Number indicating forecast horizon. Horizon = 1 means
  #                  one-step forecast and Horizon > 1 means a one-step forecast
  #                  and all multi-step forecasts from horizon 2 to 'Horizon'.
  # ModelError[1:TimeSteps4ModelSelection, 1:Horizon]    Numerical matrix with
  #                          one-/multi-steps in columns and the time steps
  #                          rowwise. The error is according to the scheme of a
  #                          rolling forecasting origin. The length depends on
  #                          the minimum required length for constructing the
  #                          wavelet model and the length of data. The newer
  #                          part of the data is used for the model fit
  #                          truncating the oldest data according to the minimum
  #                          required length for constructing the model.
  # ModelMAE                 Integer: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) computed for the
  #                          in-sample-forecast resulting from a rolling
  #                          forecasting origin.
