  # WaveletCoefficients[Scales, n]    Matrix with 'Scales' many wavelet scales
  #                                   row-wise with n columns corresponding
  #                                   to the time domain of a time series
  # SmoothCoefficients[Scales, n]     Matrix with 'Scales' many smooth
  #                                   approximation scales row-wise with n
  #                                   columns corresponding to the time domain
  #                                   of a time series
  # CoefficientCombination[1:Scales+1]    Numerical vector with numbers which
  #                                       are associated with wavelet levels.
  #                                       The last number is associated with the
  #                                       smooth level. Each number determines
  #                                       the number of coefficient used per
  #                                       level. The selection follows a
  #                                       specific scheme.
  # Aggregation[1:Scales]    Numerical vector carrying numbers whose index is
  #                          associated with the wavelet level. The numbers
  #                          indicate the number of time in points used for
  #                          aggregation from the original time series.
  #
  # OUTPUT
  # future_point    Numerical value carrying one step forecast.
